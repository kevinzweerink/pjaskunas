                <h4 class="section-header">Praise for Hidden</h4>

                <dl class="praise">
                    <dd>“Hidden is not really like anything you’ve read before. It’s no small feat for a male novelist to write in the first person voice of a female protagonist, but Paul Jaskunas has it down completely, no hint of a stutter of misstep. Ostensibly a book about a crime, it is really about the universal mystery of identity.”</dd>

                    <dt>Anna Quindlin</dt>

                    <dd>“Hidden is a novel in which the elusive truth about a violent crime is chased down in a narrative that is as original as it is well-structured.”</dd>

                    <dt>Times Literary Supplement</dt>

                    <dd>“Jaskunas creates a hauntingly intricate weave of events in his first novel, which has the quality of a fever dream... As much as Hidden is a novel of suspense, it is also an elegant exploration of vulnerability when it’s seeded by guilt and loss.”</dd>

                    <dt>The New York Daily News</dt>
